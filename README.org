* Moodl-rs

** Getting Started

You'll need ~sqlite3~ on your system, go ahead and install that if you haven't. It's included in the flake if you're on nix. When you first initialize moodl-rs, ~config.toml~ will be placed in ~~/.config/moodl-rs~ and the database is stored at ~~.local/share/moodl-rs~.

#+begin_src sh
cargo run
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh
Choose a command to run:
[i] Init - Initialize user information
    Ensure 'config.toml' has your Moodle Mobile Service Key and URL.
[f] Fetch - Fetch course materials
[p] Parse - Parse a course
[D] Download - Download a course
[d] Default - Run the default commands
i
Track the course TEST_COURSE_1?
[y] Yes, track it
[n] No, skip it
n
Track the course TEST_COURSE_2?
[y] Yes, track it
[n] No, skip it
y
Track the course TEST_COURSE_3?
[y] Yes, track it
[n] No, skip it
n
#+end_src

Then fetch your course materials:

#+begin_src sh
Choose a command to run:
[i] Init - Initialize user information
    Ensure 'config.toml' has your Moodle Mobile Service Key and URL.
[f] Fetch - Fetch course materials
[p] Parse - Parse a course
[D] Download - Download a course
[d] Default - Run the default commands
f
#+end_src

** Setup

The configuration is handled in ~config.toml~, yours should look like this to start:

#+begin_src sh
## config.toml
## This holds the default configuration for moodl-rs
## Update this with your own information

## API
## The base_url and token are required before starting
## initilization will fetch your userid
[api]
base_url = "https://your.site.com/webservice/rest/server.php"
token = "12345x7rb2n3456zo1i6ai8nquh5j18c"
userid = 123456

## Courses
## The id and shortname will be updated with your new courselist
## once you initialize the database, then the path can be updated
[[courses]]
id = 1
shortname = "ONE"

[[courses]]
id = 2
shortname = "TWO"
#+end_src

Running the ~init~ command will prompt you for the base url and token, then automatically fetch your user id and prompt which courses to track.
